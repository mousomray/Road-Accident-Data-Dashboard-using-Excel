# Road-Accident-Data-Dashboard-using-Excel
Business Problem & Objective :- In this interactive Dashboard, I've created a comprehensive view of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. 
The objective was to provide valuable insights to clients and shed light on accident trends.

# I worked on this project 
* Data Collecting
* Data cleaning & gathering 
* Data Processing
* Data Analysis & Visualization
* Enhanced Functionality
* Final Insights


# Data cleaning & gathering 
Collecting the Excel file and performed various activities such as applying filters, removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming 
the data into an easily analyzable format.

# Data Processing 
To create trendlines for CY and PY casualties, added Year and Month columns using the TEXT() function on the Date column.

# Data Analysis & Visualization 
* Created Total Casualties Data using Pivot Table in Dashboard.
* Created a Donut chart to analyze the Total casualties & its percentage with respect to accident severity.
* Consolidated similar type of vehicle type using Pivot Table analyze option.
* Created a Donut chart to analyze the maximum casualties by Vehicle type, which was a Car.
* Inserted different vehicle type icons through Illustration section and Created a data of Total casualties 
  with respect to Vehicle Type in Dashboard.
* Created a Combo 2-D line chart to understand the Monthly trend representing comparison of casualties for CY and PY.
* Created a Horizontal Bar Chart to know the maximum casualties by Road Type.
* Consolidated similar type of Road surface condition and Created a Tree map chart to understand the Distribution of 
  total casualties through types of Road Surface.
* Consolidated similar Light condition and Created doughnut chart to understand the relation between
  casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night.
  
# Enhanced Functionality 
Added filter panels and established connections to all the required pivot tables. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary 
icons for seamless navigation and created a Data analysis sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to 
ease their work and gathered information.

# Final Insights 
* Casualties of Car is the highest among all vehicles (333485).
* Casualties of Single carriageway is highest among all Roads (309.7K).
* Urban area has the highest casualty rate as compared to Rural area (255.9K).
* The amount of casualties is greater in the light condition than in the dark condition (305.0K) .
* Casualties is highest on Dry surface (279445).
* Casualties in 2021 are higher than in 2022
